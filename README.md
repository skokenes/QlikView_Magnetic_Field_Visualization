QlikView Magnetic Field Visualization
================================================================================
This QlikView document contains an example of visualizating events that occur in relation to the alignment of Earth's magnetic field. Using 2 radar charts, each event is plotted against it's relation to Earth's axis. The mean and 95% confidence interval of the sample data is also plotted. 

This visualization is based on the study ["Dog's are sensitive to small variations of the Earth's magnetic field"](http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/pdf/1742-9994-10-80.pdf) published in _Frontiers of Zoology_, where the following graph was used to illustrate how dogs align their bodies with the magnetic field while urinating and defecating:
